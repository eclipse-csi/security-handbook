## How To Report a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability in this repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or change requests.**

Instead, you can report it using one of the following ways:

* Contact the [Eclipse Foundation Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) via email
* Create a [confidential issue](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability) in the Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Tracker
* [Optional] Report a [vulnerability](https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/security/advisories/new) directly via private vulnerability reporting on GitHub

You can find more information about reporting and disclosure at the [Eclipse Foundation Security page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/).

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
